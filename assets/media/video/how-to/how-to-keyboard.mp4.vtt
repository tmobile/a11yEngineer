00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.100
Let's test this page
for keyboard accessibility.

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:08.090
The first thing I'm going to do when
the page loads is hit the tab key

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.700
and I can use tab to move forward
in the interface.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.340
And I can use Shift tab to move
backwards in the interface.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.900
As I tab around this main navigation,
you may notice that there's a highly

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.820
visible visual indication
of key board focus.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.580
It's pretty clear where I'm at that's what
we want to see on all controls needs to be

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.800
pretty obvious where I'm
at in this interface at all times.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.900
One of the first things that we sent
focus to here was called a skip link.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.300
We want to see those too.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.060
When interfaces have large chunks

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.500
of content that should be
skipped over by keyboard users.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.120
In this case, I could activate the skip
to sitemap link and jump all the way down

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.500
to the bottom of the page and navigate
the content in the footer without having

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.060
to tab through all
of the content in the page.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.700
That's very helpful.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.420
And as I tab around,

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.980
I'm able to move through the experience
because my keyboard focus is not trapped.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.980
That's important too.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.680
We never want to be trapped in one
spot as we tab around the interface.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.340
We also, while we're doing keyboard
testing, want to identify all

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:26.380
functionality that is present for mouse
users or users of other pointing devices

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.660
that those are there
for keyboard users too.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.900
So let's take a look at the
Click Here button in the Hero.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.900
If I click that,

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.820
the page scrolls down to this form
down at the bottom of the page.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.400
So I would imagine if I tab to it

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.490
and then hit Enter,
that functionality would be present.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.290
So let's try that.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.210
I'm going to tab through the navigation
and we would imagine that the next thing

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.060
that I would tab to is the next focusable
element, the Click Here button.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.290
And as I tab there, I actually skip
all the way down to the footer.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.380
Something's going on here.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.780
Why isn't this link keyboard accessible?
So at this point,

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.920
I would dive into the code and figure
out why this isn't keyboard accessible.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.060
Another important consideration while
doing keyboard testing is when we send

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.820
keyboard focus to a focusable element
that it just doesn't automatically reload

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.100
the page or submit a web
form without warning users.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.420
Odds are that when an experience is

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.060
keyboard accessible, it's on the right
track to be screen reader accessible too.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.980
So let's make sure that all mouse

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.220
functionality is present
for those keyboard users.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.860
Ensure that there's a highly visible
visual indication in keyboard focus

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.700
that there are no keyboard traps
and that that focus order is logical.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.780
We want to also make sure that when users

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.180
send focus to elements that it doesn't all
of a sudden change context for those users

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.520
and then let's look out
for those skip links too.
