# About A11yEngineer

A11yEngineer is a tool built to simplify the process of accessibility testing. 

We wanted to build an intuitive way for product teams to define "done" in a way that ensures accessible experiences work for everyone.

It uses Jekyll with a custom theme as a CMS and relies on markdown for entry creation.
