## Required attributes

### Launch button
- Should be a button, not a link
- Upon closing, focus should return to the button that launched the dialog
- **Do not**  use`aria-haspopup`. This attribute has very low and support and unpredictable output across screen readers. 

### Name
- The modal window has a logical descriptive name from either:
  - `aria-label="Modal title"` or
  - `aria-labelledby="heading-id"` pointing to an `<h2>` as a title    

### Role
- Use `role="dialog"` so the screen reader can identify this as a dialog or modal

### Group
- Upon closing, focus should return to the button that launched the dialog

### State
- Use `aria-modal="true"` to indicate content beneath the modal is inert and that the screen reader should not browse outside the dialog.

### Focus
- Use `tabindex="-1"` to make the modal itself targetable for focus
- Upon closing, focus should return to the button that launched the dialog

### Documentation
- [Browser Support](https://caniuse.com/?search=dialog)

## Code examples

### Use semantic HTML where possible

Browser support for `<dialog>` is still incomplete. 

Some browsers require additional scripting. This simple example works in Chrome, but [may not work correctly in all browsers](https://caniuse.com/?search=dialog) such as Safari and Firefox.
