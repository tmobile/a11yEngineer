## Code examples

Support varies by screen reader. It's recommended to add full aria attributes, even when using a native `<progress>` element.

### Use semantic HTML
This semantic HTML contains all accessibility features by default.

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/progress-bar.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{::nomarkdown}
<example>
{% include /examples/progress-bar.html %}
</example>
{:/}


## Developer notes

### Name
- Use `aria-label="Progress bar name"` when there is not a visible title.

### Role
- Use `role="progressbar`

### Group
- If the progress bar is describing another region of the page, use `aria-describedby="progressbar-id"` to connect the two elements.

### State
- The state will be read out to the screen reader user by default.

### Focus
- Progress bar is not usually focusable.
