## Code examples


### Custom Expander Accordion (ARIA Disclosure Widget)
This custom expander uses a semantic button with `aria-expanded` with additional scripting to toggle content and states.

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/expander.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{::nomarkdown}
<example>
{% include /examples/expander.html %}
</example>
{:/}

## Native expander (details/summary)
- This semantic HTML contains all accessibility features by default with no scripting required.
- It uses [CSS pseudo attributes](https://github.com/tmobile/magentaA11y/blob/main/_sass/modules/_details-summary.scss) to create the expanded/collapsed indicator, no Javascript.

**Note:** Due to known accessibility support issues in recent versions of iOS, `<details>` is not recommended for expander accordions. We recommend the use of an ARIA Disclosure Widget which has very robust support.

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/details-summary.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{::nomarkdown}
{% include /examples/details-summary.html %}
{:/}


## Developer notes

### Name
- Inner text must describe the purpose

### Role
- Native button identifies as button by default
- Use `role="button"` for custom elements

### Group
- You *can* use `aria-controls="popupId"`, but it is not well supported

### State
- Expanders use `aria-expanded="true/false"` 

### Focus
- Focus must be visible

## Design notes

- [Nielsen Norman Group study](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/accordion-icons/): The caret icon most clearly indicated to users that it would open an accordion in place, rather than linking directly to a new page.
- Not all users will notice there is hidden content or understand how these work. For this reason, you should only use them in specific situations and if user research supports it.
