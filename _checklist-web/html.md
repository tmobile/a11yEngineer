## Developer notes

### Validate your code

Use [HTML validation](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) as the foundation for ensuring your page works for everyone.

## Code examples

### Declare a language

This affects the screenreader pronunciation.

{% highlight html %}
<html lang="en">
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

### Give your page a unique title

- Each page must have unique `<title>` in the `<head>`
  - This includes single page dynamic apps _if_ the URI changes during the user journey
- Do not use the `|` pipe character as a divider (it is read by screen readers)

{% highlight html %}
<head>
  <title>Page title - Website title</title>
</head>
{% endhighlight %}

### Ensure users can zoom in

People with low vision need the ability to enlarge the page on mobile and desktop.

{% highlight html %}
<head>
  <meta name="viewport" 
        content="width=device-width, 
        initial-scale=1">
</head>
{% endhighlight %}

### Structure your page with landmarks

Landmarks give structure to the page for the screenreader user to be able to navigate the page by major sections.

Each page must include:

- [Header](/checklist-web/header/)
- [Nav](/checklist-web/nav/)
- [Main](/checklist-web/main/)
- [Footer](/checklist-web/footer/)

{% highlight html %}
<header>
  <!-- Contains the site title -->
</header>
<nav>
  <!-- Primary navigation menu-->
</nav>
<main> 
  <!-- Main content -->
</main>
<footer>
  <!--  Site map and legal info -->
</footer>
{% endhighlight %}
