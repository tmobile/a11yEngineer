## Code examples

### Use semantic HTML
This semantic HTML contains all accessibility features by default. 

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/input-text.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{::nomarkdown}
<example>
{% include /examples/input-text.html %}
</example>
{:/}

### Required input

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/input-text-required.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{::nomarkdown}
<example>
{% include /examples/input-text-required.html %}
</example>
{:/}

### Disabled but focusable input

- There may be times that it is advantageous for the input to be disabled but still focusable
- Fully disabled inputs are not focusable and may not be as discoverable in a form
- Use readonly to prevent editing

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/input-text-disabled-focusable.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{::nomarkdown}
<example>
{% include /examples/input-text-disabled-focusable.html %}
</example>
{:/}

### Fully disabled input

- Fully `disabled` inputs are not focusable so may not be as discoverable in a form

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/input-text-disabled.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{::nomarkdown}
<example>
{% include /examples/input-text-disabled.html %}
</example>
{:/}


### `readonly` input

- Only use readonly when presenting **already submitted** information.
- `readonly` inputs are focusable but not editable
- VoiceOver does not describe `readonly` attribute, so `aria-disabled` was added to reinforce that it's not editable

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/input-text-readonly.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{::nomarkdown}
<example>
{% include /examples/input-text-readonly.html %}
</example>
{:/}

### Email input

- Setting type="email" changes the keyboard for mobile app users

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/input-email.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{::nomarkdown}
<example>
{% include /examples/input-email.html %}
</example>
{:/}

### Group of inputs

After the screenreader focuses on each input, it will read the group name "Enter your personal information" after the input.

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/input-text-group.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{::nomarkdown}
<example>
{% include /examples/input-text-group.html %}
</example>
{:/}

## Developer notes

### Name
- Include `for="input-id` in each `<label>` label to associate it with the input
- Use `aria-label="Input name"` as a last resort if a `<label>` can't be used
- Don't hide the label on focus

### Role
- Identifies as a text input

### Group
- Include `for="input-id` in each `<label>` label to associate it with the input
- Use `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` to name a group of inputs.

### Focus
- Focus must be visible
