## Code examples

### Use semantic HTML

- There are two containers in the HTML that have the same counter content. One of them is hidden from screen readers by use of `aria-hidden="true"` and the other visually hidden container's content is dynamically updated after a slight pause. This is to ensure the screen reader does not interrupt the announcement of the key pressed with the announcement of the dynamic counter text update.
- While the visible counter text container is hidden with `aria-hidden="true"` it is still programmatically associated with the textarea by use of `aria-describedby`. This will ensure the text will be announced when the textarea receives focus.  
- **Delay the update** for dynamic `role="status"` counter
  - Use `setTimeout`to allow the accessibility tree and screen reader time to update in a logical fashion e.g. 1500ms
- **Do not** reference the `role="status"` element with aria-describedby
  - This causes a bug in VoiceOver
