## Code examples

### As radio group

This radio group uses CSS to reverse the visual order of the radio inputs while preserving accessibility.

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/input-stars.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{::nomarkdown}
{% include /examples/input-stars.html %}
{:/}

### Displaying star ratings

The element should clearly express the rating and scale.

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/stars.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{::nomarkdown}
{% include /examples/stars.html %}
{:/}
