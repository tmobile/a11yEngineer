## Code examples

### Use as much semantic HTML as possible

This semantic HTML contains all accessibility features by default, and only requires the addition of `role="switch"`. 

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/input-switch.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{::nomarkdown}
<example>
{% include /examples/input-switch.html %}
</example>
{:/}

### Disabled and focusable

If it's helpful for screenreaders to perceive a disabled toggle, use `aria-disabled="true"` and prevent click events with scripting.

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/input-switch-disabled-focusable.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{::nomarkdown}
<example>
{% include /examples/input-switch-disabled-focusable.html %}
</example>
{:/}

### Disabled and not focusable

Using the `disabled` attribute will prevent the input from being clickable, but will also prevent it from being focusable, making it more difficult to discover for screenreaders.

{% highlight html %}
<input type="checkbox"
        role="switch"
        id="deltaSwitch"
        disabled
        checked>
<label for="deltaSwitch">Delta</label>
{% endhighlight %}


### You can also use a button

This `<button>` toggle has focus and keyboard criteria built in. It requires the addition of `role="switch"` and scripting to toggle `aria-checked="true/false"`.

{% highlight html %}
<button role="switch" aria-checked="true">
  Alpha
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

### When you can't use semantic HTML

This custom switch requires extra attributes and keyboard event listeners.

{% highlight html %}
<div role="switch" tabindex="0" aria-checked="true">
  Alpha
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

## Developer notes

### Name
- `label` text should describe the input.
- Use `aria-describedby="hint-id"` for hints or additional descriptions
- `aria-label="Switch purpose"` can also be used (as a last resort)

### Role
- Use `role="switch"`

### Group
- Semantic HTML
    - `<fieldset>` should wrap a switch group
    - `<legend>` should describe the group's purpose
    - Each `<label>` must include `for="input-id"` to be associated with its input
- Custom elements
    - Use `role="group"` in the palace of fieldset
    - Use `aria-labelledby="label-id"` to associate an element as a label
    - `aria-label="Group purpose"` can also be used if there's no label with an ID

### State
- Semantic HTML
    - Use `checked` for native HTML
    - Use the `disabled` state for inactive switches
- Custom element
    - Use `aria-checked="true/false"` to express state
    - Use `aria-disabled="true"` to declare inactive elements
    - Use `aria-readonly="true"` to declare a switch can't be edited

### Focus
- Focus must be visible
