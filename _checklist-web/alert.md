## Code examples

Use alerts sparingly. The alert will be read by the screen reader when it becomes visible / appears in the DOM.

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/alert.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{::nomarkdown}
<example>
{% include /examples/alert.html %}
</example>
{:/}


## Developer notes

### Name
- Inner text describes alert

### Role
- Use `role="alert"` 

### Focus
