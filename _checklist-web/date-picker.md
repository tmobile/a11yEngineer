## Developer notes

[Full WAI-ARIA requirements](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/dialog-modal/datepicker-dialog.html)

An accessible date picker will have the following components:
### Launch button
- Opens the date picker
- Focus returns to this button on closing the popup dialog

### Date picker popup dialog
- The dialog itself should be labelled by the month and year with `aria-labelledby="month-year-heading-id"`
- Use `aria-live="polite"` for the dialog, `aria-live="polite"` for month/year heading

### Calendar navigation buttons
- Use `aria-label="Previous"` and `aria-label="Next"` to name the buttons.

### Date grid table
- Use `aria-labelledby="month-year-heading-id"` to label the table

### Date picker buttons
  - Use `aria-selected="true"` to indicate state
