## Developer notes

### Animations (like gifs) can be accessible if:
- they are set to stop after 5 seconds or 
- if users are presented with a way to pause it

## Code examples

### Allow animations to be disabled with CSS

People with vestibular disorders can be made ill by sweeping animations on screen.

It is important to change or disable animations when device reduce motion settings are activated.

This can be accomplished via CSS media query.

{% highlight css %}
@keyframes bounce {
  0% { transform: scale(1); }
  25% { transform: scale(.9); }
  50% { transform: scale(1); }
  75% { transform: scale(1.1); }
  100% { transform: scale(1); }
}

@keyframes dissolve {
  0% { background-color: green; }
  50% { background-color: darkgreen; }
  100% { background-color: green; }
}

.animation {
  background-color: green;
  animation: bounce 2s linear infinite both;
}

@media (prefers-reduced-motion) {
  .animation {
    animation-name: dissolve;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/animation.html %}
{% endhighlight %}


### Bouncy box
If your device is set to reduce motion, the animation will softly fade from one color to the next instead of bounce; otherwise it will bounce.

{::nomarkdown}
<example>
{% include /examples/animation.html %}
</example>
{:/}

### Detecting with JS
{% highlight javascript %}
const pref = 
  window.matchMedia(
    '(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)'
  );
{% endhighlight %}
