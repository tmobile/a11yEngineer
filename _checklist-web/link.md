## Code examples

### Use semantic HTML
This semantic HTML contains all accessibility features by default. 

{% highlight html %}
<a href="/about/">
  About
</a>
{% endhighlight %}

{% raw %}
<example>
<a href="/about/">
  About
</a>
</example>
{% endraw %}

If a link has no definable url, add `tabindex="0"` to make it focusable.

{% highlight html %}
<a tabindex="0">
  About
</a>
{% endhighlight %}

{% raw %}
<example>
<a tabindex="0">
  About
</a>
</example>
{% endraw %}

### Avoid custom elements
This custom button requires extra attributes and event listeners.

{% highlight html %}
<custom-element role="link" tabindex="0">
  About
</custom-element>
{% endhighlight %}

### When there are repeating links

Sometimes the design will call for multiple links with the same text label. In a case like this, `aria-label` can be used to name each link's purpose.

{% highlight html %}
<a href="/security/" aria-label="Security policy">
  Learn more
</div>
<a href="/privacy/" aria-label="Privacy policy">
  Learn more
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

### Don't repeat the name in the aria-label

**Do not** repeat the inner text content of a link in the `aria-label`.

{% highlight html %}
<a href="/dont-repeat-yourself/" 
   aria-label="Don't repeat yourself">
   Don't repeat yourself
</div>
{% endhighlight %}{: .bad-example}

## Developer notes

### Name
- Inner text should describe the purpose of the link.
- **Do not** repeat the inner text content of a link in the `aria-label`

### Role
- Native button identifies as button by default
- Use `role="link"` for custom elements

### Focus
- Focus must be visible
- Custom elements need `tabindex="0"` to be focusable
