    Moves focus to each form control in the pattern
  double-tap: |
    If select is focused, opens select, selects option

## Code examples

### Speciality stepper integer input
Before using this pattern, consider if using a plain [Select dropdown](https://www.magentaa11y.com/checklist-web/select/) might be more clear and simple for all users. A select does everything that this stepper does, and with less code! Plus, a select is native and accessible out of the box.

This component is useful for small range increments. If the max count is more than 20, consider use of a [Text Input](http://127.0.0.1:4000/checklist-web/text-input/) field as this component will be cumbersome for people using a mouse.

## Developer notes

- This stepper example provides both `button` and `select` elements for users to change a value.

- A non-visual live container with `aria-live="polite"` is present in the page at DOM load. When the `button` elements are activated, this non-visual live container is updated with dynamic content that screen reader users will hear announced as they increment or decrement the value. This dynamic text is then removed from the DOM after a few seconds (but not the actual container with `aria-live="polite"`) so the message is not discovered by screen reader users after interaction. The content of this message dynamically created based on the <code>Label</code> for the <code>Select</code> and the current value of the <code>Select</code>. e.g. "Quantity updated, 4"

- The value of the `select` element naturally communicates the updated value to screen reader users so the live container is not updated when that form element is interacted with.

- The `button` `aria-label` values should be plain text and they should include context of what they affect when activated (typically the label for the `select`).  e.g. Increase Quantity, Add Quantity

- <code>aria-disabled="true"</code> will be applied to the buttons when either end of the range is reached

- Related alternative patterns: [Select dropdown](https://www.magentaa11y.com/checklist-web/select/) or an [ARIA Spinbutton](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/spinbutton/examples/datepicker-spinbuttons/).
