## Code examples

### Use semantic HTML

This semantic HTML contains all accessibility features by default.


{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/main.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{::nomarkdown}
{% include /examples/main.html %}
{:/}


### When you can't use semantic HTML

This custom main element requires extra attributes.

{% highlight html %}
<div role="main" tabindex="-1" id="example-main"> 
  <h1>About our company</h1>
  <p>The main content of the page belongs here.</p>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

## Developer notes

### Name
- Typically doesn't have a name other than its role.

### Role

- Identifies itself as a main landmark
- If a non-semantic element must be used (like a `<div>`) use `role="main"`.

### Group

- Should contain the main content of the page.

### Focus

- Can be targeted with a skip link, but isn't focusable with the tab key
- Use `tabindex="-1"` to make the main targetable with a skip link.
