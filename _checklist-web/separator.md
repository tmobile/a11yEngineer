## Developer notes

Separators should be ignored by the screenreader.

It is preferred to create these lines with CSS rather than using a DOM element.


## Code examples

If you are unable to use appropriate CSS styles, add `aria-hidden="true"` to ensure it doesn't distract from the experience.

### Semantic HTML

{% highlight html %}
<hr aria-hidden="true">
{% endhighlight %}

### Custom elements

Angular Material uses a dom element to create separators.

{% highlight html %}
<div role="separator" aria-hidden="true"></div>
{% endhighlight %}
