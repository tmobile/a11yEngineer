## UX design notes

Think carefully before you use a carousel or slideshow wizard.

### Carousels are often a poor design choice

- As a general rule, [carousels should be avoided](https://shouldiuseacarousel.com/) for critical functionality unless there is a strong business case.
- People must be highly motivated to engage with a carousel beyond the first slide.
- A good business case might be a multi-step lead form, but this should always be A/B tested against a traditional scrolling form.

### Carousels can be a development challenge

- Logical focus order and updates for the screen reader may be complex interactions for developers.

## Code examples

### Use semantic HTML

This is one example of an accessible carousel wizard.
- It is not the only way to build a carousel, but it meets all the critieria:
  - The group has a name
  - New slides titles are announced
  - Arrow keys advance the slides

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/carousel.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{::nomarkdown}
{% include /examples/carousel.html %}
{:/}
