<div role="region" 
     aria-label="Screenreader browser pairing table"

## Developer notes

### Name
- Use `aria-label="Container purpose"` to give the container a name and purpose.

### Role
- Use `role="region"` to set apart the div as a landmark.

### Focus
- Use `tabindex="0"` to make the container element focusable
- Focus must be visible
