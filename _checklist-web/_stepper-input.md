## Code examples

### Speciality stepper integer input

This component is useful for small-ish selections. If the max count is more than 20, this component will be cumbersome for people using a mouse.

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/input-select-stepper.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{::nomarkdown}
<example>
{% include /examples/input-select-stepper.html %}
</example>
{:/}

## Developer notes

This example provides the simplest answer to a number input with a stepper control with minimal scripting.

Notice that the stepper buttons are hidden from the screen reader because it's a better user experience to simply use the native select.

Using a select also eliminates any issues with the update being read by the screenreader on button press.

### Notable failed prototype attempts

- Do not use a `input type="number"` â€” NVDA doesn't support number inputs
- Wrapping a `input type="text"` with `aria-live="assertive"` isn't reliably output across all screen readers on change events
