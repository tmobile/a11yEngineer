## Code examples

### Use semantic HTML

- This semantic HTML contains all accessibility features by default. 
- Placing the show password checkbox ahead of the password input increases discoverability for screen reader users.
  - CSS pseudo elements are used in the checkbox label to express its state on focus of the password input.

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/input-password.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{::nomarkdown}
<example>
{% include /examples/input-password.html %}
</example>
{:/}

## Developer notes

### Name
- Include `for="input-id` in each `<label>` label to associate it with the input
- Use `aria-label="Input name"` as a last resort if a `<label>` can't be used

### Role
- Identifies as some kind of secure input

### State
- The show password checkbox must indicate its state on focus

### Group
- Include `for="input-id` in each `<label>` label to associate it with the input
- Use `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` to name a group of inputs.

### Focus
- Focus must be visible
