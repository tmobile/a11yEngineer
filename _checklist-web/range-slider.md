## Code examples


### Semantic HTML
While there is a native range input, it is difficult to style reliably across browsers.

This is one of the exceedingly rare instances where a custom element makes a lot of sense.

{% highlight html %}
{% include /examples/input-range.html %}
{% endhighlight %}

{::nomarkdown}
<example>
{% include /examples/input-range.html %}
</example>
{:/}


### Custom elements

This is a rare instance where custom elements are easier to style reliably across browsers.

{% highlight html %}
<div id="range-label">
  How much cowbell?
</div>
<div class="track">
  <div id="thumb"
       role="slider"
       tabindex="0"
       aria-valuemin="0"
       aria-valuenow="10"
       aria-valuemax="11"
       aria-labelledby="range-label">
  </div>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

## Developer notes

### Name
- Include `for="input-id` in each `<label>` label to associate it with the input
- Use `aria-label="Input name"` as a last resort if a `<label>` can't be used
- Don't hide the label on focus

### Role
- Identifies as a text input

### State
- aria-valuemin
- aria-valuemax
- aria-valuenow

### Group
- Include `for="input-id` in each `<label>` label to associate it with the input
- Use `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` to name a group of inputs.

### Focus
- Focus must be visible
