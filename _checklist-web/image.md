## Code examples

### Describe the content of the image
If you were describing the image to someone who couldn't see it, what would you say?

{% highlight html %}
<img src="/farm.jpg" 
     alt="Rustic barn surrounded by rolling hills">
{% endhighlight %}

### Linked SVG that conveys meaning

{% highlight html %}
<img src="/coffee-roaster.svg" 
     role="img"
     alt="Coffee roaster">
{% endhighlight %}

### Images that are decorative

There are times that images shouldn't be read because they would be repetitive or not add any value to the content.

- When the `alt` attribute is empty, the screen reader ignores it. 
  - The `alt` attribute is still required to be valid html.
- Use `aria-hidden="true"` as a backup and reinforcement:
  - As a backup: **developers often mistakenly omit the alt attribute entirely**, meaning that some screenreaders will read the entire filename.
  - As a **reinforcement** to ensure the screenreader ignores the image. Screenreaders have been observed reading an image role when the alt attribute is present but empty.

{% highlight html %}
<img src="/info-icon.png" aria-hidden="true" alt="">

<!-- The ="" is not necessary for an empty attribute -->
<img src="/info-icon.png" aria-hidden="true" alt >
{% endhighlight %}

### Inline SVG that conveys meaning
{% highlight html %}
<svg role="img" focusable="false">
  <title>Accessible Name</title>
  <use xlink:href="#svg-id" aria-hidden="true" />
  <!-- if not using <use> then the child elements 
       of the inline SVG would go here -->
</svg>
{% endhighlight %}

### Inline SVG `<use>` that conveys meaning
{% highlight html %}
<svg role="img" aria-label="Name" focusable="false">
  <use xlink:href="#..." aria-hidden="true"></use>
</svg>
{% endhighlight %}


### Inline SVG that is decorative
{% highlight html %}
<svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false">
  <!-- ... --> 
</svg>
{% endhighlight %}

## Developer notes

### Animations (like gifs) can be accessible if:
- they are set to stop after 5 seconds or 
- if users are presented with a way to pause it
