## Code examples

### Custom listbox with autocomplete

Custom listboxes are notoriously difficult to build in an accessible fashion for screenreaders.

- [WAI-ARIA examples](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/examples/combobox/combobox-autocomplete-list.html)

### Semantic input with datalist autocomplete

- This simple native HTML example illustrates all the functionality of a listbox with inline autocomplete.
  - Support and functionality on mobile devices varies.
