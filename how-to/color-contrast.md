Testing color contrast is a simple yet crucial step in ensuring content is perceivable for users with low vision and color blindness. 

## <step-number>1</step-number> General requirements
{: .divider }
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provide very specific color contrast requirements:
- Normal text (up to 18pt/24px or 14pt/18.5px if bold) must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 between the text color and background color.
- Large text (at least 18pt/24px or 14pt/18.5px if bold) must have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 between the text color and background color.
- Meaningful graphics, user interface components and their various states, as well as focus indicactors must have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 with the background color. 
- <strong>Exceptions:</strong> Logos, incidental or decorative text and graphics, and disabled controls do not need to meet color contrast requirements. 

## <step-number>2</step-number> How to test

### Automated scanning

Automated scanning tools, such as [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/), [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/), or [Deque's Axe DevTools](https://www.deque.com/blog/axe-devtools-extension-update-new-color-contrast-analyzer/) are a great starting point for color contrast testing. All of these tools can run page scans that quickly generate reports identifying color contrast issues. Scans are:

- <strong>Good</strong> at identifying simple issues like solid colored text on solid colored backgrounds that do not meet contrast ratios. 
- <strong>Bad</strong> at idenitfying anything more complex like text on background images, gradients, and different states for user interface components (like hover or focus) that do not meet contrast ratios.

### Manual testing

Automated scanning must be complemented with a manual review of the page.  

#### <strong>Getting started</strong>
- Open DevTools in your browser window (<span class="keyboard-key">F12</span>)
- Right-click and select "Inspect" on the different color combinations that you see as you move from the top of the page on down
- Find the hexidecimal color values in the "Styles" tab of your DevTools window (see example image below)
- Enter the hex values into a contrast checking tool (like [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) or [Deque's Color Contrast Analyzer](https://dequeuniversity.com/color-contrast)) to see if they meet contrast requirments.

<example>
  <img
    src="/assets/images/examples/hex-codes-for-contrast.png"
    alt="Inspecting an element in chrome to find hex codes">
</example>
{:/}

#### <strong>Hover to inspect</strong>
- Chrome has an "Inspect Element by Mouse" DevTools feature that is useful for checking contrast
- Click the button located in the upper left-hand corner of your DevTools window to enable the feature
- Hover over elements on the page with your cursor
- A popup will appear that often indicates whether the element passes contrast by displaying a green check mark within a circle (see example image below)

{::nomarkdown}
<example>
  <img
    src="/assets/images/examples/chrome-contrast-inspector.png"
    alt="using Chrome's inspect element by mouse feature to see if element meets contrast requirmenets">
</example>
{:/}

#### <strong>Background images and gradients</strong>

- Identify instances of text and user insterface elements that sit on top of background images or color gradients
- Use a color picker tool to get representative hex codes from the background
- In Chrome's DevTools, under the "Styles" tab you can click on any of the color boxes to bring up the Color Picker popup 
- Within the popup, activate the eyedropper icon
- Hover over the desired area on the background image with your cursor and click
- The hex value will be displayed in the Color Picker (see example image below)

{::nomarkdown}
<example>
  <img
    src="/assets/images/examples/chrome-color-picker.png"
    alt="using Chrome's color picker and eyedropper tool to get hex codes for background images.">
</example>
{:/}

#### <strong>State changes</strong>
- Identify interactive elements that change color based on their states, such as focus or hover
- Ensure that the state changes meet contrast requirements
- You can force some state changes to persist, which makes them easier to check
- Inspect the desired element 
- In Chrome's DevTools, under the "Styles" tab, activate the ":hov" toggle button
- Select the checkbox with desired state
- This will force a persistent state and allow you to check for contrast on the element (see example image below) 

{::nomarkdown}
<example>
  <img
    src="/assets/images/examples/set-hover-state.png"
    alt="using Chrome's DevTools to force hover state on a link.">
</example>
{:/}

### Browsers

- Any major browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) is acceptable for color contrast testing.
