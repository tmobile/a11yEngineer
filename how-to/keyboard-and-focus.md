# Keyboard & Focus
Manual testing is not difficult or time consuming once a team understands keyboard interactions.

It is crucial to **test with only the keyboard first**, without the screen reader activated.

### Why keyboard testing is so important

- Keyboard accessibility is **prerequisite** to screen reader accessibility. 
  - If it doesn't work with only the keyboard, it won't work with a screen reader.
- screen reader applications will sometimes cover missing functionality that the sighted keyboard user won't be able to use.

### Devices

- Test with a mobile device and a bluetooth keyboard
- Test with a desktop device and a keyboard

### Browsers

- Any major browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) is acceptable for keyboard testing.
- Note: In Safari, you'll have to activate tab in Preferences » Advanced » Press Tab
