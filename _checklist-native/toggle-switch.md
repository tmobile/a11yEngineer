## Developer Notes

- Switch or Toggle Button - A switch is a visual toggle between two mutually exclusive states â€” on and off
- You should use a native switch when at all possible vs a custom element, as it will automatically and correctly announce the role without additional development effort
- A toggle should just toggle on or off.  It should not automatically navigate the user to another field or screen when toggled, as that would most likely cause a change of context. Revealing new information on the same screen as a result of activating a toggle is usually not a change of context.
- Name, Role, State must be announced when focus is on the control, if it is isolated in the table row. Announcing the label before the switch does not meet this requirement.


### Name

- Name describes purpose while focus is on the control (or on the whole table row)
- Name should match the visible label, if any, or text in the table row

- **iOS Tips**
	- Set a label in Interface Builder in the Identity Inspector
	- Group visible text label and the control in the same view container: `accessibilityFrameInContainerSpace`
	- `setTitle( )` method
	- If no visible label, use `accessibilityLabel` on control
	- `Hint` is used sparingly and if the results of interacting with it are not obvious from the control's label
	- To hide labels from VoiceOver announcements, uncheck the Accessibility Enabled checkbox in the Identity Inspector or use `isAccessibilityElement=false`
	- If hiding visible label from screen reader, use `accessibilityLabel` on control
- **Android Tips**  
	- `android:text` XML attribute
	- Optional: use `contentDescription` for a more descriptive name, depending on type of view and for elements without a visible label
	- `contentDescription` overrides `android:text`  
	- Use `labelFor` attribute to associate the visible label with the control (Best practice)

### Role

- Role is automatically announced if a native component is used
- When not using native controls (custom controls), roles will need to be manually coded.

- **iOS Tips**
	- Standard UISwitchControl
	- "double tap to toggle setting" is expected announcement
- **Android Tips**
	- Standard RadioButton with RadioGroup when applicable
	- "double tap to activate" or "double tap to toggle" is expected announcement

### Groupings

- Group visible label/text with switch (label and switch can be grouped together in a tableview/row/blade - all in one swipe)

- **iOS Tips**
  - `accessibilityFrame`
  - `accessibilityFrameInContainerSpace`
  - GroupView
  - Create a wrapper as an accessible element
  - Define action upon double-tap
  - `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` attribute: For a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.
  - `GroupView`
  - `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren` attribute indicates whether VoiceOver must group it's children views. This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page
  - Only the container class is an accessible element `isAccessibilityElement=true` and announces all elements in one announcement  This makes child elements no longer accessible by screen reader 
- **Android Tips**
	- ViewGroup
	- Set the container objects `android:screenReaderFocusable` attribute to true, and each inner object's `android:focusable` attribute to false. In doing so, accessibility services can present the inner elements' `contentDescription` or names, one after the other, in a single announcement

### State

- States can be selected, dimmed/disabled, on/off, checked/unchecked

- **iOS**  
	- Active: `isEnabled property`
	- Disabled: `UIAccessibilityTraitNotEnabled`
	- disabled/dimmed
	- on/off:  `isOn` or `setOn`   
	- Announcement: dimmed, on/off, "double tap to toggle setting" 
        
- **Android**
	- Active: `android:enabled=true`
	- Disabled: `android:enabled=false`
	- on/off: `isChecked`, `setChecked`
	- Announcement: disabled, on/off, "double tap to activate" or "double tap to toggle"

### Focus

- Only manage focus when needed. Primarily, let the device manage default focus order
- Screen reader focus should be around the entire tablerow/blade when there is one interactive element (switch)  
- Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views or containers
- External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes needs focus management

- **iOS**
	- `accessibilityElementIsFocused` 
	- `isAccessibilityElement` makes the element visible or not to the Accessibility API
	- `accessibilityElementsHidden` indicates that the children elements of the target element are visible or not to the Accessibility API
	- `accessibilityViewIsModal` contains the screen reader focus inside the Modal
	- To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content: `UIAccessibilityLayoutChangedNotification`
	- To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: `UIAccessibilityAnnouncementNotification`
- **Android**
	- `importantForAccessibility` makes the element visible to the Accessibility API
	- `android:focusable`
	- `android=clickable`
	- Implement an `onClick( )` event handler for keyboard, as well as `onTouch( )`
	- `nextFocusDown`
	- `nextFocusUp`
	- `nextFocusRight`
	- `nextFocusLeft`
	- `accessibilityTraversalBefore` (or after)
	- To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content: `Type_View_Focused`
	- To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: `accessibilityLiveRegion`(set to polite or assertive)
	- To hide controls: `Important_For_Accessibility_false`
