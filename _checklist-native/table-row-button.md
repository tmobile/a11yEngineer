## Developer notes

- A scrolling, single-column row or list of rows that can be divided into sections or groups
- You should use a native component rather than custom component, because it will announce the correct built-in screen reader output for free.

## iOS

### Name
- Programmatic name describes the purpose of the control.
- If visible text label exists, the programmatic name should match the visible text label.
    - **Note:** Setting a programmatic name while a visible text label exists may cause VoiceOver to duplicate the announcement of the name. If this happens, hide the visible text label from VoiceOver recognization.

- **UIKit**
  - You can programmatically set the visible label with `setTitle()`.
    - The button’s title will overwrite the button’s `accessibilityLabel`.
  - If a visible label is not applicable in this case, set the button's `accessibilityLabel` to the label of your choice.
    - To do this in Interface Builder, set the label using the Identity Inspector
  - To hide labels from VoiceOver programmatically, set the label's `isAccessibilityElement` property to `false`
  - To hide labels from VoiceOver using Interface Builder, uncheck `Accessibility Enabled` in the Identity Inspector.
- **SwiftUI**
  - If no visible label, use view modifier `accessibilityLabel(_:)`.
  - If button has icon(s), hide the icon(s) from VoiceOver by using view modifier `accessibilityHidden(true)`.

### Role
- When using non-native controls (custom controls), roles will need to be manually coded.

- **UIKit**
  - Implement a `UITableVIew` and set the specific `UITableViewCell` as interactive or capable of a tap gesture.
  - If user is redirected away from the app, set `accessibilityTraits` to `.link`.
  - If user is redirected to a screen within the app, set `accessibilityTraits` to `.button`.
- **SwiftUI**
  - Use native `List` view
  - If user is redirected away from the app, use view modifier `accessibilityAddTraits(.isButton)` to assign the role as Link.
  - If user is redirected away from the app, use view modifier `accessibilityAddTraits(.isLink)` to assign the role as Link.
  - If applicable, use view modifier `accessibilityRemoveTraits(:)` to remove unwanted traits.  

### Groupings
- Group visible label with table row, if applicable, to provide a programmatic name for the table row.
- Group label with data to ensure reading order is logical. (Not label, label, data, data).

- **UIKit**
  1. Ensure that the child elements of the overarching view you want to group in has their `isAccessibilityElement` properties set to false.
  2. Set `isAccessibilityElement` to `true` for the parent view. Then, adjust `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityTraits` accordingly.
  - If frame does not exist due to custom table row, use `accessibilityFrameInContainer` to set the custom control’s frame to the parent view’s container or view of your choice.
    - You can also unionize two frames with `frame.union` (i.e. `titleLabel.frame.union(subtitleLabel.frame)`).
  - Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityElement` for a precise order if the native order should be disrupted.
  - Use `shouldGroupAccessibilityChildren` to indicate whether VoiceOver must group its children views. This allows making unique vocalizations or define a particular reading order for a part of the page.
- **SwiftUI**
  - Use view modifier `accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` to merge the child accessibility element’s properties into the new accessibilityElement.

### State 
- **UIKit**  
  - For enabled: Set `isEnabled` to `true`.
  - For disabled: Set `isEnabled` to `false`. Announcement for disabled is "Dimmed".
    - If necessary, you may change the accessibility trait of the table rows to `notEnabled`, but this may overwrite the current accessibility role of the table row.
- **SwiftUI**
  - For disabled, use view modifier `disabled()`.

### Focus
- Use the device's default focus functionality. 
- Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views.
- External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.
- Initial focus on a screen should land in a logical place, such as back button, screen title, first text field, or first heading.
- When a menu, picker, or modal is closed, the focus should return to the triggering element.

- **UIKit**
  - If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`
    - **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.
  - Use `accessibilityViewIsModal` to contain the screen reader focus inside the modal.
  - To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.
  - To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.
  - `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements.  
- **SwiftUI**
  - For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.
    - Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.
    - Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.
  - If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.

## Android

### Name

- Name describes the purpose of the control and matches the visible label, which can all be grouped together in the table row in an accessibility label

### Role

- Add header trait to table rows that describe a section if needed and do not make header row interactive
- **Android View**
  - Use an interactive RecyclerView
  - Should be coded as a list, if more than one row
- **Android Compose**
  - Use regular `Column` for a table row with short list, and `LazyColumn` for the long list of items. For the row to behave as button role, use `modifier.clickable` with role of `role.Button`

### Groupings

- Group text label/ images/controls together in one swipe
- Only one interactive control can be in the swipe    
- **Android View**
  - ViewGroup
  - Set the container object's android:screenReaderFocusable attribute to true, and each inner object's android:focusable attribute to false. In doing so, accessibility services can present the inner elements' content descriptions/names, one after the other, in a single announcement.
- **Android Compose**
  - In `item` or `items` composable of the table, the `modifier.clickable` with the role of button will group the internal components automatically.

### State

- **Android View**  
  - Active: android:enabled=true
  - Disabled" android:enabled=false. Announcement: disabled
  - Announcement: Selected/ "not selected" for row with a checkmark
- **Android Compose**
  - Active: `enabled=true`
  - Disabled: `enabled=false`

### Focus

- Only manage focus when needed. Primarily, let the device manage default focus.  
- Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views.
- **Android View**
  - android:focusable=true
  - android=clickable=true
  - Implement an onClick( ) event handler for keyboard, not onTouch( )
  - nextFocusDown
  - nextFocusUp
  - nextFocusRight
  - nextFocusLeft
  - accessibilityTraversalBefore (or after)
  - To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content: Type_View_Focused
  - To NOT move focus, but announce new content: accessibilityLiveRegion
  - To hide controls: Important_For _Accessibility_NO
- **Android Compose**
  - `Modifier.focusTarget()` makes the component focusable
  - `Modifier.focusOrder()` needs to be used in combination with FocusRequesters to define focus order
  - `Modifier.onFocusEvent()`, `Modifier.onFocusChanged()` can be used to observe the changes to focus state
  - `FocusRequester` allows to request focus to individual elements with in a group of merged descendant views
  - *Example:* To customize the focus events behaviour
      - step 1: define the focus requester prior. `val (first, second) = FocusRequester.createRefs()`
      - step 2: update the modifier to set the order. `modifier = Modifier.focusOrder(first) { this.down = second }`
      - focus order accepts following values: up, down, left, right, previous, next, start, end
      - step 3: use `second.requestFocus()` to gain focus
