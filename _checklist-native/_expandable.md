## General
- An expandable region is a view that shows items in a two-level list; groups which can individually be expanded to show its children.
- The expand/collapses indicator (caret) is never focused separately.  As part of a table row/list view, the label, images and other non-interactive content in the row are usually announced together. The caret shows the state, which should be announced as part of the whole row announcement.
- When the row is activated to expand, the focus stays on that row and does not automatically move to the new content.

## iOS

## Developer notes
- Name, Role, State must be stated in a single announcement when focus is on the control area or whole row (caret icon should never gain focus alone).

<!-- 
Enter information for iOS Name, update information below with appropriate details, or remove details not needed
-->
### Name
- Programmatic name describes the purpose of the control.
- If visible text label exists, the programmatic name should match the visible text label.
    - **Note:** Setting a programmatic name while a visible text label exists may cause VoiceOver to duplicate the announcement of the name. If this happens, hide the visible text label from VoiceOver recognization.
<!-- 
Enter information for iOS Name using UIKIT, update below with appropriate details, replace expandable region with new component name or appropriate description
-->
- **UIKit**
  - You can programmatically set the visible label with `setTitle()`.
    - The expandable region title will overwrite the expandable region `accessibilityLabel`.
  - If a visible label is not applicable in this case, set the expandable region `accessibilityLabel` to the label of your choice.
    - To do this in Interface Builder, set the label using the Identity Inspector
  - To hide labels from VoiceOver programmatically, set the label's `isAccessibilityElement` property to `false`
  - To hide labels from VoiceOver using Interface Builder, uncheck `Accessibility Enabled` in the Identity Inspector.

- When using non-native controls (custom controls), roles will need to be manually coded.

### Groupings
- Group visible label with expandable region, if applicable, to provide a programmatic name for the expandable region.
- Group label with data to ensure reading order is logical. (Not label, label, data, data).

### Focus
- Use the device's default focus functionality. 
- Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views.
- External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes this functionality requires additional development to manage focus.

<!-- 
Enter information for iOS Focus using UIKit, update below with appropriate details
-->
- **UIKit**
  - If VoiceOver is not reaching a particular element, set the element's `isAccessibilityElement` to `true`
    - **Note:** You may need to adjust the programmatic name, role, state, and/or value after doing this, as this action may overwrite previously configured accessibility.
  - Use `accessibilityViewIsModal` to contain the screen reader focus inside the modal.
  - To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content, use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.screenChanged` and the newly revealed content as the parameter arguments.
  - To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: use `UIAccessibility.post(notification:argument:)` that takes in `.announcement` and the announcement text as the parameter arguments.
  - `UIAccessibilityContainer` protocol: Have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements. 

<!--

- **SwiftUI**
  - For general focus management that impacts both screen readers and non-screen readers, use the property wrapper `@FocusState` to assign an identity of a focus state.
    - Use the property wrapper `@FocusState` in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:)` to assign focus on a view with `@FocusState` as the source of truth.
    - Use the property wrapper `@FocusState`in conjunction with the view modifier `focused(_:equals:)` to assign focus on a view, when the view is equal to a specific value.
  - If necessary, use property wrapper `@AccessibilityFocusState` to assign identifiers to specific views to manually shift focus from one view to another as the user interacts with the screen with VoiceOver on.

### Name
- Name describes the purpose of the control
- Programmatic name matches the visible text label (if any)

<!-- 
Enter information for Android Name for Android Views, update information below with appropriate details, or remove details not needed
-->
- **Android Views**
  - `android:text` XML attribute
  - Optional: use `contentDescription` for a more descriptive name, depending on type of view and for elements (icons) without a visible label
  - `contentDescription` overrides `android:text`
  - Use `labelFor` attribute to associate the visible label with the control

<!--

- **Jetpack Compose**
  - Compose uses semantics properties to pass information to accessibility services.
  - Example specification of contentDescription in compose: `modifier = Modifier.semantics { contentDescription = "" }`

- **Android Views**
  - `ViewGroup`
  - Set the container object's `android:screenReaderFocusable` attribute to true, and each inner object's `android:focusable` attribute to false. In doing so, accessibility services can present the inner elements' `contentDescription` or names, one after the other, in a single announcement.

  - `Modifier.semantics(mergeDescendants = true) {}` is equivalent to `importantForAccessibility` when compared to android views
  - `FocusRequester.createRefs()` helps to request focus to inner elements with in the group

### Focus
- Only manage focus when needed. Primarily, let the device manage default focus
- Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views
- External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes needs focus management

<!-- 
Enter information for Android Focus for Android Views, update information below with appropriate details, or remove details not needed
-->
- **Android Views**
  - `importantForAccessibility` makes the element visible to the Accessibility API
  - `android:focusable`
  - `android=clickable`
  - Implement an `onClick( )` event handler for keyboard, as well as `onTouch( )`
  - `nextFocusDown`
  - `nextFocusUp`
  - `nextFocusRight`
  - `nextFocusLeft`
  - `accessibilityTraversalBefore` (or after)
  - To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content: `Type_View_Focused`
  - To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: `accessibilityLiveRegion`(set to polite or assertive)
  - To hide controls: `importantForAccessibility=false`
  - For a `ViewGroup`, set `screenReaderFocusable=true` and each inner objectâ€™s attribute to keyboard focus (`focusable=false`)

<!-- 
Enter information for Android Focus for Jetpack Compose, update information below with appropriate details, or remove details not needed
-->
- **Jetpack Compose**
  - `Modifier.focusTarget()` makes the component focusable
  - `Modifier.focusOrder()` needs to be used in combination with FocusRequesters to define focus order
  - `Modifier.onFocusEvent()`, `Modifier.onFocusChanged()` can be used to observe the changes to focus state
  - `FocusRequester` allows to request focus to individual elements with in a group of merged descendant views
  - Example: To customize the focus events
    - step 1: define the focus requester prior. `val (first, second) = FocusRequester.createRefs()`
    - step 2: update the modifier to set the order. `modifier = Modifier.focusOrder(first) { this.down = second }`
    - focus order accepts following values: up, down, left, right, previous, next, start, end
    - step 3: use `second.requestFocus()` to gain focus

### Custom Accessibility Action
- When UI elements are customized and coded to look like a specific component say button, to ensure that name, role, state and action are all intact might need to update accessibility service and semantics.
- Disclaimer: This customization would not be needed unless it is required to modify/add gestures or actions.

  - List of custom accessibility actions can be defined relatively easily in compose compared to Views using customActions. 
  - Example: `modifier = Modifier.semantics { customActions = listOf(CustomAccessibilityAction(label = "", action = { true }))}`
