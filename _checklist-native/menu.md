## Developer notes

- A menu is a container for a list of items
- Use native menus when at all possible vs a custom element, as it will handle expected behavior without additional development effort
- Options to close the menu for the screen reader user:  An invisible close button announced for the screen reader only, can be in the swipe order after the last menu item.  Two/three finger swipe to close (Android).  A close button.
- Confining the user within the menu communicates the context to the screen reader user that there is a menu or modal present. If menu hides content underneath it, the screen reader focus should be confined within the menu.
- Tapping outside the modal to close cannot be the only option for screen reader users

### Name

- Name describes the purpose of the control (Ex: opens settings menu or closes menu), with additional label description if needed
-   **iOS Tips**
    -   Set a label in Interface Builder in the Identity Inspector
    -   If no visible label, use `accessibilityLabel` on control/icon
    -   If hiding visible label from screen reader, use `accessibilityLabel` on control
-   **Android Tips**  
    -   `android:text` XML attribute
    -   Use `contentDescription`, depending on type of view and for elements (icons) without a visible label
    -   `contentDescription` overrides `android:text`          
    -   Use `labelFor` attribute to associate the visible label with the control  

### Role
-  Required: Screen reader user is confined inside a menu, communicating a modal is present if hiding content underneath it
-  When not using native controls (custom controls), roles will need to be manually coded.

- **iOS**
  - `UIMenu`
- **Android**
  - `android.view.Menu`  


### Groupings

- Visible label, if any, is grouped with the menu button in a single swipe  
  
- **iOS**
  - `accessibilityFrame`
  - `accessibilityFrameInContainerSpace`
  - `GroupView`
- **Android**
  - `ViewGroup`

### State

- **Expandable menus**
  - State must be announced- expands/collapses, opens/closes. Add logic and announcement to the programmatic name for the state
  - If "opens" or "closes" is not included in the name, the expands/collapses state must be announced
- **iOS**
  - Active: `isEnabled property`
  - Disabled: `UIAccessibilityTraitNotEnabled`. Announcement: dimmed  
- **Android**  
  - Active: `android:enabled=true`
  - Disabled: `android:enabled=false`. Announcement: disabled
  
### Focus

- Screen reader focus must be confined within the menu, which can include the button that opened it, if content underneath is hidden
- Focus can remain on the menu button or move to the first item in the menu
- Only manage focus when needed. Primarily, let the device manage default focus
- External keyboard tab order often follows the screen reader focus, but sometimes needs focus management
- When a menu is closed, the focus should return to the triggering element
- An invisible close button can be implemented to close the menu.  Ensure button is in the swipe order if implemented

- **iOS**
  - `accessibilityViewIsModal` contains the screen reader focus inside the Modal
  - `accessibilityElementIsFocused`  
  - `isAccessibilityElement` makes the element visible or not to the Accessibility API
  - `accessibilityElementsHidden` indicates that the children elements of the target element are visible or not to the Accessibility API
  - To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content: `UIAccessibilityLayoutChangedNotification`
  - To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: `UIAccessibilityAnnouncementNotification`
- **Android**
  - `importantForAccessibility` makes the element visible to the Accessibility API
  - `ImportantForAccessibility=no` on view beneath menu if user is confined  
  - `android:focusable`
  - `android=clickable`
  - Implement an `onClick( )` event handler for keyboard, as well as `onTouch( )`
  - `nextFocusDown`
  - `nextFocusUp`
  - `nextFocusRight`
  - `nextFocusLeft`
  - `accessibilityTraversalBefore` (or after)
  - To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content: `Type_View_Focused`
  - To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: `accessibilityLiveRegion`(set to polite or assertive)
  - To hide controls: `Important_For_Accessibility_false`
